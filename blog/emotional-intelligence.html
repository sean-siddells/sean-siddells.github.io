                <h3>What is EQ?</h3>
                <p>
                    Emotional intelligence is the ability to notice one’s own emotions and use that knowledge to then change their behaviours or thought patterns. People with high EQ are better equipped to perceive their own emotions and the emotions of people around them.
                </p>

                    IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient and is the overall score based on some standardised tests that were created to gauge human intelligence. IQ differs from EQ as it relates to a person’s ability to use logic and reasoning skills to solve problems. EQ relates to a person’s ability to perceive their own emotions and use this attention to regulate them and positively affect their outlook.

                    It’s important as it is a highly sought after skill set in the workplace and something that employers look for. It allows you to manage stress better, navigate interpersonal relationships well, defuse conflict and generally feel happier.
