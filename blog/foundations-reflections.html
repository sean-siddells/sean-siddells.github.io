            Throughout the core components of foundations, 
            I’ve learnt that I can be easily frustrated when I feel like I’m not 
            making progress, that I struggle to reach out for help from others until 
            I’m at my wits end and that through practice I’m able to improve on these 
            things and be kinder to myself.

            Your values are what are important to you and thinking about them is a good 
            way to understand yourself and your identity. Your values influence your 
            learning journey and what you bring to any environment. Being aware of 
            who you are will allow you to better engage with others on a social level 
            but also when working together. Self-awareness and empathy are important for 
            programming as they allow you to work with others bettwer. Empathy is important 
            as you need to acknowledge other people’s experience and listen to what they 
            have to say in order to be a good programmer.

            What surprised me most about core learning was the focus on mindfulness and 
            well-being. It really emphasised the importance of dealing with frustration 
            in a healthy way, and to acknowledge these feelings without judgement. I’m 
            not familiar with learning environments in which this sort of thing is a big 
            part of the curriculum and it was really interesting to learn about useful 
            information about well-being whilst also experiencing situations in which these 
            tools can be used.

            I think that interpersonal skills are hugely important in programming and maybe 
            that is often overlooked by prospective programmers. Ability to work in a team 
            and healthily communicate is key but is also just generally helpful and I consider 
            them to be good life skills to have in your repertoire. To me, it definitely feels 
            justified that this is part of the curriculum. When training for any industry I 
            think there should be more focus on preparing for the ways in which that work can 
            affect your mental health/well-being and teaching healthy coping strategies. By 
            teaching these skills I think it acknowledges the reality of working, in a way that 
            I feel isn’t really discussed in more conventional educational structures.
