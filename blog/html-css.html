                    Positioning in CSS is used as a way of moving html element placements on a web page. 
                    An "element" is just a basic unit of HTML that has an opening and closing tag that relate to their content.
                    For example, a "&lt;h1&gt;" tag signifies that the contents between this and the closing tag "&lt;/h1&gt;" will be a heading element. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Every element is a block of pixels on a webpage, and many variables of these blocks can be adjusted through CSS like size, height/width settings and position.
                    The <strong>position</strong> property allows you to change the position of the element based on several different principles 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Relative:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The relative position changes the position of the element in relation to where it would <i>usually</i> go. This means that elements will be displayed in the order they are written (either from top to bottom or left to right).
                    So "position: relative;" combined with an attribute like "right: 15px;" will move it 15px from the right of its usual position on the page.
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    <strong>Absolute:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The absolute position changes the position of the element relative to the parent element, and if there is no parent element, it will position itself in relation to the page.
                    So if we used "position: absolute;" on an element that isn't nested inside another with the attribute "right: 15px;", it will be moved 15px from the right of the page itself. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Fixed:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The fixed position adjusts the position of the element in relation to the <i>viewport</i> ie. the computer display or phone screen that the web page is being viewed on.
                    This means that the element will stay visible to the viewer even when the page is scrolled up or down. This is great if the element is an essential component to interacting with the website, however this means that this element may overlap another.
                    The position attributes in this case will be used to position the element in the web browser.
