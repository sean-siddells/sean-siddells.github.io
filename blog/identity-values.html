                I'm an introverted/slightly extroverted person. I value human connection, shared experiences, mutual respect, validation, boundaries, my independence and autonomy, connection to nature.
                I’m most proud of the steps I’ve taken to better my mental health in the last 2 years. 
                I’ve worked a lot in the hospitality industry, and throughout the years have experienced a lot of moments where I’ve felt like I don’t know which direction I’m going. I’ve had to work on being present with myself and acknowledge when something isn’t working for me, vocalise that and act on it to change my circumstance. I want to be firm but soft simultaneously.

                A situation where I had to make an ethical decision was when I decided to quit my first full-time cheffing job. 
                I was very committed and new to the industry, but I had landed myself in a position where I felt like I was being consumed by this huge churning machine. I was over-tired, depressed and struggling to reconcile the reality I was in to what I thought it would be. 
                I now know that that was just a particularly bad place for me to have started, and I was unlucky to have had that as my first job outside of graduating. 
                I remember I had this particular moment where this terrible head chef was screaming at me and all I wanted was to be anywhere other than that restaurant. 
                I knew at that moment that that would be the last day I worked there. I finished that service, packed up my knives and left knowing that I would never have to set foot in there again. 
                I learnt something valuable from that experience, to listen to myself in situations that felt wrong or felt like I’m not being mutually respected as an individual. 
                Going forward, I never want to let any job that I have dominate my life and my well being in such a negative way again. Repeatedly dealing with someone’s personal anger issues is never going to be written into your employee agreement, and therefore shouldn’t be something that needs to be tolerated day after day.

                I’m biracial, with my mother being from Brunei and my father from New Zealand. I’ve grown up in Auckland and have always questioned my sense of belonging for as long as I can remember. 
                It is a weird experience feeling like you are a part of two cultures and neither at the same time. 
                I’ve learnt a lot of values from my mother and her Chinese heritage for example generosity, sharing, love for food etc. From my father came my love of humour, the ocean and music. This has informed the way I like to spend my time and engage with others.

                I’d like to think some of my strengths in terms of learning and career development are that I have a good work-ethic, I’m adaptable and I take on feedback. 
                I think being adaptable will help me learn such a large quantity of skills over the short duration of this course. Thus far, I’ve been enjoying the feeling of overcoming solutions through self- directed research.

                A recent example of trying to work productively with others is with my flatmates during this lockdown. I’ve created a spreadsheet of meals that we can make during lockdown and all their respective ingredients so that when one person goes out to do a grocery shop, we can use it as a shopping list. This means that we can buy enough ingredients for several days worth of shared meals in one grocery trip. 
                Since I created the spreadsheet and often the recipes are ones that I have put in, I often have to lead the cooking as well as organising what we’re eating. I will ask if people want to cook dinner that night, but they are constantly asking me for advice and to supervise what they are doing, which kind of defeats the purpose of me not cooking that night. Last night, after quite a lot of questions about how to make macaroni and cheese, I found the instructional video that I had watched and sent it to both of my flatmates who were cooking. They got to direct themselves (much like the flipped classroom model), I got to chill and we had a delicious meal together!
                This strategy worked really well and will probably be using it again in the next couple of weeks.
