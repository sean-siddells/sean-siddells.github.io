                My long term goal is to be financially stable and work in a career that is not overly-physically or mentally exhaustive. I want whatever line of work I am in to feel balanced with quality time outside of work and for the culture of that field to be conducive with good health. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m perceptive and adaptable when it comes to direction and feedback. I feel like I have good initiative when it comes to learning. I think motivation and focus can sometimes be a struggle for me, so setting good working practices and sticking to them will be a good exercise throughout the duration of this course. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’d like to improve my ability to talk in larger group settings, and as I’m sure there will be a few group presentations there should be ample opportunity for me to develop this at Dev Academy. 
            </p>

                I will manage my time by regularly setting achievable workloads and breaking it in small chunks with regular breaks/intervals between. I will work towards open-mindedness and kindness towards myself and others, and not be afraid to ask for help. I will try to communicate openly and be available to talk to my cohort and the facilitators. When things get stressful I will first step away and give myself some space from the source of what is frustrating me. I will talk to the people around me and also reach out to the cohort if this persists past a point where I feel as though I can handle it by myself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I will use the slack channels provided to see if others can help me with whatever roadblocks I come across and try to do so before I’ve spent way too much time on said problem. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I expect the facilitation team to be helpful in a non-judgemental way. I expect them to be understanding and respectful when people are being vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will possibly have a few hours of admin work to do per week which might have to be shifted into the evenings or split between several days once I start bootcamp.
