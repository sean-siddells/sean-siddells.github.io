            <p>
                My long term goal is to be financially stable and work in a career 
                that is not overly-physically or mentally exhaustive. I want whatever 
                line of work I am in to feel balanced with quality time outside of work 
                and for the culture of that field to be conducive with good health. 
                I would like to use the skills I gain during this course to pursue a 
                career in programming and to see if it fits well with my values. I’d like 
                o work with my friends who have also gone through the Dev Academy and work 
                on some personal projects together. I don’t really have a destination in mind.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m perceptive and adaptable when it comes to direction and feedback. 
                I feel like I have good initiative when it comes to learning. I think 
                motivation and focus can sometimes be a struggle for me, so setting good 
                working practices and sticking to them will be a good exercise throughout 
                the duration of this course.  I think another limitation I’ve noticed I 
                have is that I tend to wait too long to ask for help. I’m hoping that 
                through the increased contact time with fellow classmates and 
                facilitators I can combat this. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’d like to improve my ability to talk in larger group settings, 
                and as I’m sure there will be a few group presentations there should be 
                ample opportunity for me to develop this at Dev Academy. I think the few 
                human skills I would like to improve whilst at Dev Academy are my self 
                awareness, ability to reflect and also to be kinder to myself. I tend 
                to judge myself quite harshly and be overly self-critical. I think there 
                is always room for improvement when it comes to communication and I hope to 
                become more confident working with others and in the way that I carry myself. 

            </p>
            <p>
                I will manage my time by regularly setting achievable workloads and breaking 
                it in small chunks with regular breaks/intervals between. I will work towards 
                open-mindedness and kindness towards myself and others, and not be afraid to ask 
                for help. I will try to communicate openly and be available to talk to my cohort 
                and the facilitators. When things get stressful I will first step away and give 
                myself some space from the source of what is frustrating me. I will talk to the 
                people around me and also reach out to the cohort if this persists past a point 
                where I feel as though I can handle it by myself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I will use the slack channels provided to see if others can help me with whatever 
                roadblocks I come across and try to do so before I’ve spent way too much time on 
                said problem. 
                I expect the facilitation team to be helpful in a non-judgemental way. I expect 
                them to be understanding and respectful when people are being vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will possibly have a few hours of admin work to do per week which might have to 
                be shifted into the evenings or split between several days once I start bootcamp.
