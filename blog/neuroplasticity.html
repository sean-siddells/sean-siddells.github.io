        <h3>Learning and the Brain</h3>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the term used to describe the brain’s ability to constantly 
            form new neural pathways and strengthen them over time. This means that learning
            is actually dependent on one’s willingness to practice and, as a result, develop 
            these strong neural connections. Understanding neuroplasticity allows one to feel 
            a greater sense of agency when it comes to changing their own behaviour and taking 
            in new information. It challenges the belief of there being “natural” talent or there 
            being a predisposition that means a person is better at something than another. 
            The brain and therefore intelligence itself, is malleable.

        <p>
            I hope to be more persistent in my practice of things that I want to learn, and 
            carry this concept of neuroplasticity as a motivator. Practicing the instruments 
            that I want to get better at, learning new skills and perhaps being more patient 
            with myself - as the new connections formed and neural pathways can only get stronger, 
            right?
            <br>
            <br>
            Getting a good amount of of sleep and exercise have both been shown to increase neuroplasticity. 

            I found this post about <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886" target="_blank">
            neuroplasticity</a> really interesting.

        <h3>The Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
            The growth mindset is the belief that your ability can be improved. It is acknowledging 
            that you may not be very competent at a certain task and understanding that it doesn’t 
            reflect negatively on you, that you can overcome it. In Carol Dweck’s TED talk (linked below),  she 
            mentioned that the way we’ve raised children has created a drive for validation, as we 
            tend to praise their results/grades. The idea that you should praise the process and 
            not so much the grade/metric for intelligence was a really salient point. Encouraging 
            persistence and curiosity as traits for children to carry into adulthood was something 
            that made me think about my nephew and how his childhood will be.

        <p>    
            I will use this idea of the growth mindset especially when I feel out of my depth and 
            remind myself that I can improve my ability instead of judging myself harshly. This combined
            with what I've learnt about neuroplasticity have highlighted the importance of taking 
            good care of my physical health and being kind to myself when I feel like I'm stuck or struggling.
