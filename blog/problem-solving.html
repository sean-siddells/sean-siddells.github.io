        <p>
            Last week I was working away on a coding exercise in which we were presented 
            with a web document that had a grid of 9 grey dots. The aim of the exercise 
            was to write functions so that, when one was clicked, it would change colours 
            and/ or disappear completely. Next to the grid were 3 numbers that were to 
            serve as a tally for how many of each colour there was (green, blue and invisible).
            The last task was to make it so that these numbers would update with each 
            click and display how many of each colour dot there were out of the 9 dots.
        </p>
        <P>
            The first part of the exercise came pretty quickly, however I got super stuck 
            on the second part of the problem - the dot counter. I went to such lengths googling
            different possible functions and trying to write loops and eventually got to a point 
            I felt as though I wasn't getting anywhere. I was getting frustrated so eventually 
            decided to take a break and come back to it with fresh eyes. When I came 
            back I read over the existing code as well as the instructions and realised that 
            what I was trying to do was a convoluted version of what the provided code was already   
            in place to do. In the end the solution was WAY more straight-forward than what I was 
            doing and after I had a better understanding of what the pre-written functions meant, I 
            was able to figure it out. I learnt a valuable lesson in this situation - read the 
            instructions thoroughly and make sure you understand what it is you're trying to do 
            before trying to write any code! 
        </P>
        <p>
            I used pseudocode quite a lot during the last couple katas, as I found them really helpful
            for writing out what I was aiming to do before I started trying to write the functions. 
            I could refer back to them as a step process to see what I was aiming to do next. Trying 
            something is probably my first go-to in terms what I would try if I reached a problem. 
            The rubber ducky method is a good thing to practice, I substituted the rubber duck for my 
            flatmate when I got stuck on a couple problems - and it actually really helped me understand
            what my code was doing when I had to explain it to someone else. Reading error messages was 
            a really valuable way of understanding what the next step was in what I was trying to achieve, 
            as well as checking the test functions in advance. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            I'm feeling more confident console.logging 
            after doing the katas, and used it more towards the end when I wanted to check the value of 
            variables to make sure I was on the right track. I've used Google A LOT throughout this 
            course, so I feel like I'm fairly confident when it comes to finding solutions through googling. 
            I think the key for me has been to make the search query as specific as possible, as that 
            seems to return more helpful resources. I feel confident asking my peers and my coaches for help, 
            everyone has been super accommodating. I think with every time that I've gotten really stuck, 
            finding a solution and then reflecting about how I could've thought about it differently or 
            approached it from another angle has been helpful for my process.
